# Tooltitude for Go

[Tooltitude for Go](https://www.tooltitude.com) is a productivity extension for the Go programming language. It helps you write better code faster. The extension is being actively developed so stay tuned for new features (Twitter is the best place to do so https://twitter.com/tooltitude). 

## Features

### CodeLens providers
Gain insights into your codebase, and understand usage patterns for functions, methods, fields, and interfaces.
We have CodeLens providers which help you navigate code and see what's going on in the code base

### Code Inspections
From unused initializations and writes to shadowed variables, unhandled errors, and deprecated symbols, our inspections help you enhance your code.

### References View
Get more information than the built-in references popup. References view allows you to see not only the file where the reference is located, but its package, function. Note: it works only with Tooltitude CodeLens providers.

### Postfix Completions
Write code faster by using familiar dot notation to generate boilerplate code: generate statements, call library functions, iterate collections and more.
